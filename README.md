# Udacity-Project-Build-a-Portfolio-Site
This was my first project in the Udacity Fullstack Web Development Online Nano Degree.

The goal was to recreate a mockup image using HTML and CSS.

This project reinforced my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and responsive design and taught me how to use flexboxes to achieve better control over designs for different viewport dimensions.

Features responsive, clean design using flex boxes and interchangeable stock photos.
